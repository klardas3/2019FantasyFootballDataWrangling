# 2019 Fantasy Football Data Wrangling

This is a project I started for fun in order to commit to memory what I was learning in Hadley Wickham's "R for Data Science" textbook.

I have always loved following the NFL and Fantasy Football, so this was a dataset that I thoroughly enjoyed wrangling.

Looking forward to learning some predictive models to apply in the future!
